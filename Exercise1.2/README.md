I rearranged the Content component to render three components, each rendering the name of a track and the number of exercises.

** NOTE **: In order to avoid unnecessary busyness while checking, I only uploaded the Content.jsx file to GitHub in Exercise 1.2. Because no changes were made to the codes of other files. Same as in Exercise1.1.
