# Full Stack Development Course

Welcome to the Fullstack Development Course repository! This repository contains all the chapters and exercises I completed throughout the course. Below you will find some information about myself, my software development journey, and my thoughts on this course.

## About me

Hello! My name is Abdullah. I am 39 years old, married and have 3 children. 

### My Software Development Journey

I started to be interested in software about 1 year ago. I was interested in software in my spare time from work. After 4-5 months of starting the software, I had to take a break because my workplace was far away and my family members had health problems. I couldn't deal with the software for about 7 months. Now I've started again and I'm thinking of developing software in my free time from work.

Software Technologies I'm Interested In:

- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Unreal Engine:** C++
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Python
- **Database Management:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines

I want to constantly learn and improve my skills. It is a pleasure to constantly learn and follow new technologies. I also believe in the importance of being aware of the latest trends and technologies in the software world.

### My thoughts about the course

Fullstack Development Course offers a great opportunity for people who do not have any documents or certificates that can indicate competence in the software field. In addition, the fact that the sections that make up the course consist of areas related to Web development made me very happy as someone who wants to improve myself as a full-stack. Thank you for your effort and interest.
