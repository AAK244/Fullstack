### My thoughts about the course

Fullstack Development Course offers a great opportunity for people who do not have any documents or certificates that can indicate competence in the software field. In addition, the fact that the sections that make up the course consist of areas related to Web development made me very happy as someone who wants to improve myself as a full-stack. Thank you for your effort and interest.
